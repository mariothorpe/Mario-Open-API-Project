# Mario-Open-API-Project
# Author: [Jamarius "Mario" Thorpe]

Introduction
------------
I’m working on a project that involves displaying “character cards” for marvel characters using data from a marvel API. 

Usage
-----
The website will generate a new “character card” when the “get random character” button is clicked. Each card should render data from the character name, character comic, character description and character image endpoints.

Installation
------------
Clone repository (git clone “url”) in terminal and run using a live extension server.
